### Project 1 : Warming Up with MNIST
This project aims to detect and recognize MNIST digit.\
I random pasted each 28x28 digit in a 75x75 black background and trained a Darknet-like model to reproduce a YoloV1 algorithm on MNIST. The model handle a unique bounding box and tries to localize a digit in a 6x6 grid.
